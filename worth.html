        <p class="description">You know, they say good things take time, like fine wine, avocado toast, or that one friend who’s always late to brunch. But let me tell you, you’re not just a “good thing.” You’re the “greatest thing”, and you’re worth every second of waiting, every ounce of effort, and every moment of patience it takes to build something real with you.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="description">Courting you isn’t just a chapter in my story; it’s the whole plot twist I didn’t see coming but I’m so grateful for. Yeah, there might be challenges, awkward moments, and maybe even a few facepalm-worthy missteps along the way, but every single one of those moments is worth it because it’s all leading me closer to you.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="description">And when I think about the future, like, really think about it. I don’t just see a relationship, I see our relationship. One that’s built on laughter, trust, and maybe a little too much chicken tenders. You’re worth every hurdle, every late-night conversation, every “what are we even doing?” moment, and every leap of faith it takes to get there. Because at the end of the day, I don’t just want a relationship, I want it to be you.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="description">So yeah, I’m all in. You’re worth every wait, every pain, every lesson, and every joy that comes with this journey. And honestly? I’d do it all over again if it meant I got to call you mine.</p>
