        <p class="description">I don’t even know where to begin, because every time I try to put my feelings into words, it feels like I’m living in a dream. Like, did I accidentally stumble into some alternate universe where someone as incredible as you exists? Because honestly, you’re too good to be true, but here you are, and I thank God for you every single day.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="description">You’re the kind of person who makes me stop and think, “How did I get this blessed?” You’re my last thought before I fall asleep and my first thought when I wake up. It’s like my brain has a permanent tab open just for you, and I’m not even mad about it. You’re the highlight of my day, the smile I can’t shake, and the reason I feel like the most blessed person on this planet.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="description">I still can’t fully comprehend how someone as kind, beautiful, and amazing as you could come into my life, but here we are. And every day, I’m reminded of how much I appreciate you, not just for who you are, but for the way you make me want to be better. You inspire me in ways I didn’t even know were possible.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="description">I care about you more than words can ever say. Like, if words were currency, I’d be broke trying to describe how much you mean to me. But just know this: you’re worth every prayer, every thought, and every moment I spend thanking God for bringing you into my life. You’re my dream come true, and I’m so grateful to be loving someone as extraordinary as you.</p>
