        <p class="description">This is how I see you. You’re the answer to Philippians 1:3, the one I thank God for every time I remember you. You’re the person I’ve prayed for, dreamed of, and waited for. Someone worth reserving my whole heart and life for. From the moment I met you, I knew you were different. You’re the kind of person who deserves all the love, kindness, and goodness this world can offer, and I’m honored to be the one who gets to give it to you.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="description">You’re worth every moment of waiting, every challenge, and every leap of faith. Like Philip and Jena’s story, you’re the kind of love that feels destined. A love built on faith, patience, and a deep connection that goes beyond the surface. You’re worth every ounce of my life force, every prayer, and every effort to love you the way you deserve. You’re not just someone I care about. You’re someone I’d give my all for, without hesitation.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="description">Most of all, you’re one of the reasons that made me believe in God’s perfect timing. You’re proof that He hears our prayers and that His plans are worth waiting for. I see His love reflected in you, in your kindness, your strength, and your heart for Him. And I’m so grateful that He brought you into my life. You’re everything I’ve hoped for and more, and I’m beyond blessed to love someone as incredible as you.</p>
