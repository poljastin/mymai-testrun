        <p class="description">I know this might sound like the opening line of a rom-com that’s way too cheesy to be real, but here we are, because you’re the most beautiful person I’ve ever met, inside and out. Like, if beauty were a competition, you’d be disqualified for being unfair to the rest of humanity. I mean, how am I supposed to focus on anything when your smile is out here lighting up rooms like a human flashlight? It’s honestly distracting (but in the best way possible).</p>

            <p class="description">And let’s talk about your heart for a second. It’s so kind and genuine that I’m pretty sure it’s powered by unicorn magic or something. I can’t even begin to comprehend how blessed I am that the Lord decided to give me this chance to know you, let alone court you. Like, did I accidentally save a small country in a past life or something? Because this feels like winning the lottery, except the prize is way better (and way prettier).</p>
